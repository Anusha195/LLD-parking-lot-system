## Problem Statement: Automated Parking Lot System
You own a parking lot that can hold up to 'n' cars at any given point in time. Each slot is given a number starting from 1 and increases sequentially with increasing distance from the entry point. You want to create an automated ticketing system to allow customers to use the parking lot without human intervention.

## When a car enters the parking lot:

1. A ticket is issued to the driver.
2. The ticket documents the registration number (number plate) and color of the car.
3. An available parking slot is allocated to the car, prioritized by the slot nearest to the entry point.
4. It is assumed that customers always park their cars in the allocated slot.
When a car exits the parking lot, the customer returns the ticket, and the system marks the slot as available. The system calculates the parking fee based on the duration the car was parked. The parking fee is set at â‚¹10 per hour.

## Government Regulations
The system should provide the following features:

* Find registration numbers of all cars of a particular color.
* Find the slot number in which a car with a given registration number is parked.
* Find all slot numbers where cars of a particular color are parked.
* Display total available slots in the parking lot.
* Calculate and display total earnings from parking fees.
* List all parked cars with their slot number, registration number, and color.
* Update the parking lot capacity dynamically (e.g., increase or decrease slots as needed).


### Example: Interactive
Assuming a parking lot with 6 slots, the following commands should be run in
sequence by typing them in at a prompt and should produce output as described
below the command. Note that `exit` terminates the process and returns control to
the shell.


Welcome to the Automated Parking Lot System!
Type 'exit' to terminate the system.
